# EduSelf
A public access curriculum database project I've been thinking about developing! Inspired by Khan Academy, EduSelf is ran as a collection of challenge-by-choice courses, meaning there nothing is assigned for a grade. Assignments are for practicing skills and applying understanding of concepts. Assignments might include journals, Google/ChatGPT investigations, and essays. (As I get better with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, etc., I hope to include assignments that can be automatically graded...!)

My goal is to create engaging classes! Hopefully some you want to take - that you've never heard of before! Explore classes you loved taking, those you never took, and a wide range of courses for students in the 21st century. Check out the 'courseplans' file for a list of future courses. Here are the courses I plan to work on first:
1. (current) ENGL 100 - "Workplace Writing and Communications", 12 weeks.
2. (next) MATH 121 - "Applied Calculus I", 12 weeks
3. (soon) HIST 165 - "Black American History", 12 weeks

Courses will cover across disciplines including:
1. History
2. Mathematics
3. Music
4. Philosophy
5. Video Game Art / Music

Note on content: learning objectives, vocabulary lists, and summaries have been generated by ChatGPT.
I embedded the videos and links. I designed the projects, assignments, and activities.
