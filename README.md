To access progress, go to "sites" directory. Go to 'courseplans' for prospective classes in the curriculum. Click on specific course folder for content.

A public access curriculum database project! Inspired by Khan Academy, EduSelf is ran as a collection of challenge-by-choice courses, meaning there is nothing assessed for a grade. Assignments are for practicing skills and applying understanding of concepts. Assignments might include journals, Google/ChatGPT investigations, and essays. (As I get better with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, etc., I hope to include assignments that can be automatically graded...!) Enjoy the courses and their content as you wish at your own pace! 

Courses have weekly themes and daily topics. Content includes [1] learning objectives for what you will learn, [2] vocabulary vital to understanding, [3] YouTube videos and hyperlinks, and [4] summaries of daily learning objectives. Projects are introduced in the beginning of the week and reinforced throughout it. 

My goal is to create engaging classes! Hopefully some you want to take - that you've never heard of before! Explore classes you loved taking, those you never took, and a wide range of courses for students in the 21st century. Here are the courses I plan to work on at first:
1. (current) ENGL 100 - "Workplace Writing and Communications", 12 weeks.
2. (next) MATH 121 - "Applied Calculus I", 12 weeks
3. (soon) HIST 165 - "Black American History", 12 weeks

Courses will cover across disciplines including:
1. History
2. Mathematics
3. Music
4. Philosophy
5. Video Game Art / Music

Note on content: learning objectives, vocabulary lists, and summaries have been generated by ChatGPT.
I embedded the videos and links. I designed the projects, assignments, and activities.
